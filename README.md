- **CI/CD Pipeline**: `.github/workflows/sandbox-test.yml` provides automated sandbox testing
- **Features**:
  - Automated contract deployment via RPC
  - API endpoint testing with live sandbox
  - Artillery benchmark execution
  - No Docker complexity - pure Node.js testing
- **Local Development**: Use testnet environment (provides identical functionality)
- **Note**: CI/CD pipeline ensures sandbox functionality works correctly without ES module conflicts

```

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 23+
- **For Sandbox Testing**: Local NEAR sandbox (handled by helper repository)
- **For Testnet Production**:
  - NEAR testnet account with private key
  - Deployed NEP-141 FT contract on testnet
  - Sufficient NEAR balance for gas fees
  - FT tokens minted to the master account

## Testing

### Automated CI/CD Testing (Recommended)
The project includes GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/sandbox-test.yml`) that provides reliable sandbox testing using near-sandbox CLI:

- âœ… **Automated contract deployment** to sandbox via RPC
- âœ… **API endpoint testing** with health checks
- âœ… **Artillery benchmark execution** in isolated environment
- âœ… **No ES module conflicts** (near-sandbox CLI isolation)

**Trigger**: Runs automatically on every push/PR to `main` branch.

### Sandbox Testing (Local Development)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Psianturi/near-ft-helper.git
cd near-ft-helper && npm install && node deploy.js
```

### Testnet Testing (Production Environment)
```bash
# 1. Setup NEAR testnet account
# Create account at https://wallet.testnet.near.org/
# Fund with NEAR tokens for gas fees

# 2. Deploy FT contract to testnet
git clone https://github.com/Psianturi/near-ft-helper.git
cd near-ft-helper && npm install
node deploy-testnet.js  # Requires MASTER_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY in .env

# 3. Configure service for testnet
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your testnet account details
# MASTER_ACCOUNT=your-account.testnet
# MASTER_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY=ed25519:your-private-key

# 4. Start service
npm start

# 5. Test transfer
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/send-ft \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"receiverId": "receiver.testnet", "amount": "1000000"}'
```

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Psianturi/fungible-token-claim-service.git
cd fungible-token-claim-service
npm install
```

### Dependencies

The service uses hybrid NEAR libraries for optimal performance:
- **Sandbox**: `near-api-js` - Standard NEAR JavaScript SDK
- **Testnet**: `@eclipseeer/near-api-ts` - High-performance TypeScript SDK for concurrent transactions

All dependencies are automatically installed via `npm install`. The `@eclipseeer/near-api-ts` package provides efficient access key nonce management for high-throughput transaction processing.

## Configuration

Copy the example environment file and configure it:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your NEAR account details
```

### Environment Variables

- `NEAR_ENV`: Set to `testnet` for production or `sandbox` for local testing
- `MASTER_ACCOUNT`: Your NEAR account ID (e.g., `your-account.testnet`)
- `MASTER_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY`: Your NEAR private key (ed25519 format)
- `FT_CONTRACT`: FT contract account ID
- `NODE_URL`: RPC endpoint URL
- `RPC_URLS`: Comma-separated list of RPC providers for load balancing

See `.env.example` for complete configuration options.

## Usage

### Start Service

#### For Development/Testing (Sandbox)
```bash
# Start sandbox first
git clone https://github.com/Psianturi/near-ft-helper.git
cd near-ft-helper && npm install && node deploy.js

# Then start API service
NEAR_ENV=sandbox npm run start:sandbox
```

#### For Production (Testnet)
```bash
# Requires real NEAR testnet accounts and deployed FT contract
npm start
```

### API Usage

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/send-ft \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"receiverId": "user.testnet", "amount": "1000000", "memo": "Transfer"}'
```

## Development

```bash
npm run build  # Build TypeScript
npm test       # Run tests (when available)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "The account doesn't have enough balance"
- **Cause**: FT contract lacks tokens for transfers
- **Solution**: Mint additional tokens to the master account or top-up contract balance

#### "Can not sign transactions for account... no matching key pair"
- **Cause**: Invalid or incorrect private key in `.env`
- **Solution**: Verify private key format and account ownership

#### RPC Connection Issues
- **Cause**: Network connectivity or RPC provider issues
- **Solution**: Check internet connection and try different RPC providers

#### ZodError or parsing errors
- **Cause**: RPC response format incompatibility
- **Solution**: Use NEAR official RPC for testnet (`https://rpc.testnet.near.org`)

#### "Expected string not undefined(undefined) at value.signerId" (Sandbox)
- **Cause**: ES module global state conflicts with near-workspaces programmatic usage
- **Solution**: This is a known limitation. Use testnet environment instead:
  ```bash
  # Switch to testnet
  export NEAR_ENV=testnet
  npm start
  ```
- **Note**: Manual near-cli commands work fine, but programmatic API calls fail in sandbox mode

## Security Notes

- **No authentication implemented** (designed for internal use)
- **Private keys must be valid NEAR ed25519 keys** (64-byte binary format)
  - The sample keys in `.env` are placeholders and will cause validation errors
  - Replace with actual NEAR account private keys for production use
  - Error: `Length of binary ed25519 private key should be 64` indicates invalid key format
- Store private keys securely in environment variables
- Consider adding rate limiting for production deployment
