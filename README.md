### Sandbox Results Analysis

#### ‚úÖ **What's Working Well**:
1. **API Service Startup**: Service initializes correctly
2. **Request Validation**: Input sanitization working properly
3. **Security Checks**: Invalid receiver ID properly rejected
4. **Error Handling**: Meaningful error responses
5. **Concurrent Handling**: Multiple requests processed simultaneously
6. **CI Integration**: Automated testing pipeline functional

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Current Limitations**:
1. **Contract Deployment**: NEAR 2.6.5 vs SDK 5.x compatibility issues
2. **WASM Deserialization**: "Error happened while deserializing the module"
3. **Schema Compatibility**: PublicKey serialization mismatches
4. **Node.js Version**: Artillery requires Node 20+ for full functionality

#### üîß **Technical Challenges**:
- **NEAR Runtime Version**: Sandbox uses 2.6.5, contract compiled with SDK 5.x
- **Borsh Serialization**: Schema mismatches between runtime versions
- **ES Module Compatibility**: Global state conflicts in testing environment

### Sandbox Testing (Local Development)

#### Option 1: Complete Automated Pipeline (Recommended)
```bash
# Full testing pipeline with sandbox, contract, and load testing
./test-complete-pipeline.sh

# Custom configuration
TEST_DURATION=600 MAX_TPS=200 ./test-complete-pipeline.sh
```

#### Option 2: Manual Setup
```bash
# 1. Start NEAR sandbox
npx near-sandbox init
npx near-sandbox run &

# 2. Deploy FT contract (if needed)
export NEAR_CONTRACT_ACCOUNT_ID="test.near"
export NEAR_SIGNER_ACCOUNT_ID="test.near"
export NEAR_SIGNER_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY="ed25519:..."
node ci/deploy-sandbox-rpc.mjs

# 3. Start API service
npm run start:sandbox

# 4. Run load testing
./run-artillery-test.sh sandbox
```

### Testnet Testing (Production Environment)
```bash
# 1. Setup NEAR testnet account
# Create account at https://wallet.testnet.near.org/
# Fund with NEAR tokens for gas fees

# 2. Deploy FT contract to testnet
git clone https://github.com/Psianturi/near-ft-helper.git
cd near-ft-helper && npm install
node deploy-testnet.js  # Requires MASTER_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY in .env

# 3. Configure service for testnet
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your testnet account details
# MASTER_ACCOUNT=your-account.testnet
# MASTER_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY=ed25519:your-private-key
# FT_CONTRACT=your-ft-contract.testnet

# 4. Start service
npm run start:testnet

# 5. Run load testing
./run-artillery-test.sh testnet

# 6. Test single transfer
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/send-ft \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"receiverId": "receiver.testnet", "amount": "1000000"}'
```

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Psianturi/fungible-token-claim-service.git
cd fungible-token-claim-service
npm install
```

### Dependencies

The service uses hybrid NEAR libraries for optimal performance:
- **Sandbox**: `near-api-js` - Standard NEAR JavaScript SDK
- **Testnet**: `@eclipseeer/near-api-ts` - High-performance TypeScript SDK for concurrent transactions

All dependencies are automatically installed via `npm install`. The `@eclipseeer/near-api-ts` package provides efficient access key nonce management for high-throughput transaction processing.

## Configuration

Copy the example environment file and configure it:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your NEAR account details
```

### Environment Variables

- `NEAR_ENV`: Set to `testnet` for production or `sandbox` for local testing
- `MASTER_ACCOUNT`: Your NEAR account ID (e.g., `your-account.testnet`)
- `MASTER_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY`: Your NEAR private key (ed25519 format)
- `FT_CONTRACT`: FT contract account ID
- `NODE_URL`: RPC endpoint URL
- `RPC_URLS`: Comma-separated list of RPC providers for load balancing

See `.env.example` for complete configuration options.

## Usage

### Start Service

#### For Development/Testing (Sandbox)
```bash
# Start sandbox first
git clone https://github.com/Psianturi/near-ft-helper.git
cd near-ft-helper && npm install && node deploy.js

# Then start API service
NEAR_ENV=sandbox npm run start:sandbox
```

#### For Production (Testnet)
```bash
# Requires real NEAR testnet accounts and deployed FT contract
npm start
```

### API Usage

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/send-ft \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"receiverId": "user.testnet", "amount": "1000000", "memo": "Transfer"}'
```

See [`ARTILLERY_TESTNET_RESULTS.md`](ARTILLERY_TESTNET_RESULTS.md) for complete testnet benchmark analysis.

## Development

```bash
npm run build  # Build TypeScript
npm test       # Run tests (when available)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "The account doesn't have enough balance"
- **Cause**: FT contract lacks tokens for transfers
- **Solution**: Mint additional tokens to the master account or top-up contract balance

#### "Can not sign transactions for account... no matching key pair"
- **Cause**: Invalid or incorrect private key in `.env`
- **Solution**: Verify private key format and account ownership

#### RPC Connection Issues
- **Cause**: Network connectivity or RPC provider issues
- **Solution**: Check internet connection and try different RPC providers

#### ZodError or parsing errors
- **Cause**: RPC response format incompatibility
- **Solution**: Use NEAR official RPC for testnet (`https://rpc.testnet.near.org`)

#### "Expected string not undefined(undefined) at value.signerId" (Sandbox)
- **Cause**: ES module global state conflicts with near-workspaces programmatic usage
- **Solution**: This is a known limitation. Use testnet environment instead:
  ```bash
  # Switch to testnet
  export NEAR_ENV=testnet
  npm start
  ```
- **Note**: Manual near-cli commands work fine, but programmatic API calls fail in sandbox mode

#### "Error happened while deserializing the module" (Contract Deployment)
- **Cause**: NEAR runtime 2.6.5 incompatibility with SDK 5.x compiled contracts
- **Solution**: Use testnet environment for production testing:
  ```bash
  # Deploy contract to testnet first
  cd near-ft-helper && node deploy-testnet.js

  # Then test with real blockchain
  NEAR_ENV=testnet npm start
  ```
- **Note**: This is a fundamental version compatibility issue between sandbox runtime and modern SDK

## üéØ Recommendations for 100+ TPS Achievement

### Current Status:
- **Target**: 100 TPS
- **Achieved**: 93 TPS (93% target) + 300+ TPS di testnet
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **CLOSE TO TARGET**

### Optimization Strategies:

#### 1. **Testnet Focus** (Recommended)
```bash
# Use testnet for accurate performance measurement
NEAR_ENV=testnet npm start
./run-artillery-test.sh testnet
```

#### 2. **Contract Optimization**
- Deploy contract with compatible NEAR version
- Use official NEAR testnet for realistic performance testing
- Consider contract-level optimizations for higher throughput

#### 3. **API Service Tuning**
- Increase `CONCURRENCY_LIMIT` to 2000+
- Optimize `BATCH_SIZE` for your specific use case
- Use multiple RPC providers for load balancing

#### 4. **Load Testing Enhancement**
- Use longer test duration (10+ minutes) for stable measurements
- Implement gradual load increase for realistic scenarios
- Monitor memory usage and garbage collection

## Security Notes

- **No authentication implemented** (designed for internal use)
- **Private keys must be valid NEAR ed25519 keys** (64-byte binary format)
  - The sample keys in `.env` are placeholders and will cause validation errors
  - Replace with actual NEAR account private keys for production use
  - Error: `Length of binary ed25519 private key should be 64` indicates invalid key format
- Store private keys securely in environment variables
- Consider adding rate limiting for production deployment
